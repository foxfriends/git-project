Your first task is to set up your project board. Give your project a name and description, make sure the columns are to your liking, and maybe even put in a few tasks!

Here's how:
1.  Git hooks have not been added to your repository yet. If automatic task management is a feature you are interested in, run `git project hooks` to append them to your existing hooks, or integrate them manually (see the project README online).
2.  Open the editor by running `git project open`, and set the name, description, columns, and maybe even add some tasks.
3.  There's no need to move this task to the "Done" column - it will be moved automatically later (assuming you set the hooks up)
4.  Commit your changes. There will be instructions in the generated commit message for how to proceed.
